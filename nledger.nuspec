    <description>## .Net Ledger: Double-Entry Accounting System

.Net Ledger (NLedger) is a complete .Net port of the [Ledger](http://ledger-cli.org), excellent powerful command line accounting system. The main purpose of this project is to enable all features of Ledger to .Net world. 

NLedger command line utility (NLedger.cli) is highly compatible with the original Ledger. It supports all original features and command line options; the produced output is 100% equal. The reliable level of compatibility is verified by Ledger tests that are 99% passed (with exception of few ones that require unavailable on Windows features). It is expected that people may feel like they use the genuine Ledger but in Windows command line.

NLedger is written on pure C# with no dependencies on any external libraries or any platform-specific features. It lets NLedger properly work on any Windows (or .Net compatible) system and be easily portable to any .Net platform.</description>
